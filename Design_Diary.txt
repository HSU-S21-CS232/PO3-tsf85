Well the backend for this was started a little late. My friend was trying to help me add some cool sentiment scraping 
from Youtube closed captions for the boardgame review videos to try and get some arbitrary quantitative rating system
set up so I could do some sort of linear regression for bias... It's not ready. I was trying to sneak it in with this,
but i really just wasted time within the deadline.

Other than that I got frustrated with Pyside and switched to PyQt after having written a decent amount. I also wasted
a couple of days trying to get some sort of progress bar, or even just a label that updates to indicate that the 
program is still working and not frozen. This seemed key, as the first two buttons creates and fill the files you 
need for the rest of the program to work, and they take a while to finish.

The most fun thing is the same as always. Finally understanding what you're parroting from the internet to some extent
and getting it to work.

as for unresolved issues; I still haven't added more reviewers, so it leaves the program seeming a little lackluster,
but my previous mistakes of getting lost in more scraping with a deadline detered me from trying. The second thing is 
not really knowing how to handle the checkboxes dynamically enough. If the right boxes aren't seleceted it'll just break
the program. Not typing anything into the LineEdit at the bottome before clicking "Do it!" at the bottom will also break
it.

Advice for a future student would probably be to just try out the simple option given for the whole class if you
aren't very experienced.
